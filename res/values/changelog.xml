        &lt;b>HELP&lt;/b>&lt;br>
        ReLaunch is a versatile reading programs launcher and system-wide shell for Nook Simple Touch (also supported by Sony PRS-T1).&lt;br>
        It is assumed that the user library is organized in an ordered structure
        of folders and files have names of books that match their names.&lt;br>
        ReLaunch supports flexible configuration of many on-screen buttons for quick
        access to certain features of the program and run third party applications.&lt;br>
        Non-obvious possibilities:&lt;br>
        - Some functions of the program available only with run as a desktop shell for system.&lt;br>
        - Some functions require a device with root-access, or only implemented for
        Nook Simple Touch (you will receive appropriate notice).&lt;br>
        - On-screen scrolling buttons support double click to navigate to the specified
        number of percents in list and long-click to quickly move to the end (beginning) of the file list.
        This feature often will not work properly, be careful (you need to enable it in settings).&lt;br>
        - If you open with the button, for example, the second-to-read book, it will be after the opening of the first.
        Thus, you will start in round fashion two (three, etc., depending on the configuration), the last-readed books.&lt;br>
